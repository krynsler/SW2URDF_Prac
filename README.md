# SW2URDF_Prac
This repository contains the CAD part files &amp; assembly of a Robotic Arm used to create a URDF file using SOLIDWORKS.<br>  It also contains the raw exported URDF files created via the sw2urdf add-in.<br>
<br>
You can use the CAD files to practice creating your own assembly, or you can utilize the pre-made assembly with the axes and co-ordinate systems for each joint. Alternatively you can use the raw exported urdf files to go ahead with simulation.
